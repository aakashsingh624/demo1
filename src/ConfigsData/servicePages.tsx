                Trademarks are an important tool in the marketing of any goods
                and services. A trademark can be any word, phrase, design or
                combination of these things that identifies your goods or
                services and distinguishes you from other firms in the
                marketplace. They help companies to protect their individual
                rights by preventing anyone else from using their names, brands
                or trademarks for their own benefit.
                <br />
                <br />
                Your company’s reputation, once built, can be a difficult thing
                to protect and hold true through market changes. When you think
                of goodwill, it often comes to mind with brands that have been
                around for years or decades. Our trademark services are designed
                to help you create a brand that stays true to what your business
                is selling, who you are and where you fit.
                <br />
                <br />
                At MTLegalTeam, we help you register your trademarks and perform
                trademark searches during the process. Our professional service
                will make sure that your trademarks are protected!

                Innovation and invention is the new and unique design, process

                <br />
                <br />
                A Patent is an exclusive right given by a sovereign authority to
                an inventor for his invention for a designated period depending
                on the country. These patents are known as Intellectual Property
                Rights. They are an incorporeal right that allows you to
                innovate and make an invention without having to worry about
                someone stealing it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Each patent law is different and covers the subject matter more
                in-depth than any other legal aspect. Our qualified online
                attorneys have the knowledge and experience to handle your
                entire situation; it’s how we can ensure that your patent
                application approval process happens smoothly.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you have an invention, we will help you patent it. We can
                write patent applications and claims that have the broadest
                possible protection for your invention.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of the most important steps before filing a patent
                application is ensuring whether the subject matter being pursued
                has been previously disclosed to others or not. This is why it
                is so important to identify “prior art” in your searches before
                you begin writing any patent applications.
                <br />

                Here at MTLegal, we're dedicated to helping you protect your
                valuable inventions from being used by others in a way that

                When do you require a Contract for{" "}
                <span className="text-gold">Your </span> Business?
            </>
        ),
        answer: (
            <>
                Let's face it. Writing contracts is a pain. And to be honest,
                most of us haven't read a contract in years--but we still use
                them. Find out what you need to know before signing a contract
                with someone else or buying assets (i.e. business assets, real
                estate, etc.).
                <br />
                <br />
                As your business grows, you may find yourself in need of a
                contract. Smart move. With well-crafted legal agreements, both
                parties have the right information to understand each other and
                protect their rights. A well-crafted legal agreement ensures all
                parties are on the same page while protecting their rights.
                While most businesses use contracts to create clauses that are
                applicable across multiple sectors, often it’s easier to seek
                legal advice for your specific industry and transaction-specific
                clauses.
                <br />
                <br />
                Contracts address a wide range of personal and commercial
                transactions such as asset purchase agreements (which allows one
                party to purchase assets from another), confidentiality
                agreements (ensures partners keep confidential information
                private), joint venture agreements (sets up future
                collaborations between partners and shareholders) and
                partnerships (based on ownership).
                <br />
                <br />
                Regardless of your business needs, we've got you covered. Our
                contracts will protect both your business and personal assets.
                <br />
                <br />
                <div className="font-bold text-bluePrimary text-xl">

                What if you could cut down on legal fees by up to 50%? Yes,
                that’s right. Smart contracts can make all of your business
                transactions convenient and easy. They’re flexible and can be
                customized for use in any industry; including the real estate
                industry. By adopting smart contracts, you can reduce the time
                it takes to take care of legal paperwork and waste from an
                average of 3-5 minutes per document down to just one minute.
                Even better: We have at MTLegal Team understand the ins and outs
                of legal processes—so we know how to draft smart contracts in a
                way that will make every step easier for you.
